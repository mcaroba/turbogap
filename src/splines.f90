  function spline(x, y, y2, yp1, ypn, r, rcut) result(s)

!   This function computes a cubic spline on all the points defined in
!   array r(:), for those r(i) < rcut, but constructing a cubic spline
!   interpolation. The tabulated data is given in arrays x(:) and y(:),
!   which should have the same size, assuming y(i) = y[x(i)].
!   y2(:) is the (precomputed) array of second derivatives of y(:) at the x(:)
!   points. yp1 and ypn give the constant derivatives for values to
!   the left and right of the tabulated domain. This code is an
!   implementation of the cubic spline algorithm outlined in Numerical
!   Recipes, but the code has been written from scratch from the
!   equations.
!   The algorithm is as follows for interpolating s(i) at r(i):
!
!   if r(i) > rcut: don't do anything
!
!   if r(i) < x(1): s(i) = y(1) + (r(i) - x(1)) * yp1
!
!   if r(i) > x(n): s(i) = y(n) + (r(i) - x(n)) * ypn
!
!   else:
!
!     find the index j such that x(j) <= r(i) < x(j+1)
!     h = x(j+1) - x(j) [it must be > 0.d0!!!]
!     A = (x(j+1) - r(i)) / h
!     B = 1 - A
!     C = (A^3 - A) * h^2 / 6
!     D = (B^3 - B) * h^2 / 6
!     s(i) = A*y(j) + B*y(j+1) + C*y2(j) + D*y2(j+1)
