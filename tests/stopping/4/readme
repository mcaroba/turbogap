Description ::
This test runs the EPH model with only friction option activated to reduce the energy in a Si system.
The atomic system is ~ 303 K initially and the electronic system is held fixed at 0 K throughout.
There is no dynamics in the electronic system in this case, so corresponding parameters are not provided.

Run command ::
Copy gap_files folder from ../1. Run this test with command "../path-to-turbogap-executable/turbogap md" command.

Results ::
It will produce the results as in the thermo.log (for atomic system) and eph-EnergySharingData.txt (for electronic system) files. The system can be visualized from file trajectory_out.xyz.

Plot ::
Then you can plot the temperatures and energies and see the same as shown in the Fig.# files.
