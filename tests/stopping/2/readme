Description ::
This test runs the full EPH model to equilibrate a Si system.
The atomic system is at 0 K and electronic system is at 50 K initially.
It constructs the electronic mesh from the parameters given in the input file.

Run command ::
Copy gap_files folder from ../1. Run this test with command "../path-to-turbogap-executable/turbogap md" command.

Results ::
It will produce the results as in the thermo.log (for atomic system) and eph-EnergySharingData.txt (for electronic system) files. The system can be visualized from file trajectory_out.xyz.

Plot ::
Then you can plot the temperatures and energies and see the same as shown in the Fig.# files.
