! If two cutoffs are equal, there is no buffer region between them!
! If you are doing 2b with SCS polarizabilities (basically TS-SCS) and need only energies,

! Then you get away with neighbor lists of same size as normal TS.

! neighbor lists: vdw_loc_rcut = vdw_scs_rcut and vdw_2b_rcut2 = vdw_2b_rcut
