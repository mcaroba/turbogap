! This is the dispersion potential
! You can choose between two different versions, roughly equivalent
! to a Tkatchenko-Scheffler approach with the C6 coefficient fixed to
! that of graphene. The two versions differ on the value of sR (the
! TS screening parameter for the London dispersion damping):
! 0.94 for the standard screening
! 0.893 for the screening optimized to C
! You can enable the dispersion correction by uncommenting this block,
! and switch between the two available implementations by commenting
! or uncommenting one of them (if you leave both uncommented, the last
! one will be read.
